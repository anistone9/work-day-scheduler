Calendar Application To Track Hourly Events

## Description

The application in this repository represents a calendar that allows users to save entries for each business hour for the current day. It runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The current day schedule displays the business hours color coded, with past hours styled in grey, current hour in red, and future hours in green. Each time block has a Save button, and the header displays the current date. When the user types an entry into any of the hour blocks for the day, and saves that entry, the text is displayed when the screen is refreshed.
